# PetPlanner

### Project Description 
PetPlanner is a web application built from scratch for pet lovers of all kinds to keep track of their petsâ€™ information, care providers, and events and appointments in a centralized location. After creating an account, pet owners can add a pet, specialist for their pet, and an event for the pet. Pet owners can add all their pets from horses to birds to cats and dogs.

### MVP Description
1. After creating an account, a user can add a pet to their account, and that pet will show in the cards on the dashboard. They can add as many pets as they would like and different kinds of pets from a guinea pig to a bird to a horse to a cat. The breeds are shown as a result of conditional rendering in Javascript React and Lucca's data scraping and research on breeds and creating data sets from that breed research information. Pet lovers can upload a photo of their pet with the help of the Cloudinary API. In the pet's information, many different types of information can be stored, including an emergency contact name, phone, and email and the pet's insurance company and policy number.

2. Pet lovers can add events for each of their pets using FullCalendar API, including daily or annual events based on the needs and appointments of the pet -- like vaccinations, walks, annual vet appointments, or even medication administration.

3. A user can add care providers, or specialists, for each pet. The specialists can include the pet's vet, groomer, nail trimmer, and emergency vet.  The specialists' contact information includes the phone number, address, any notes, and more that the pet owner would like to include.

### How To Use PetPlanner / What The User Can Do
1. Create an account 

![Image of the Create Account webpage](/static/images/Readme_Markdown/petplanner_Create_An_Account.png)

2. Log in

3. Log out 
Utilizing Jinja templating on the navbar: I hand-built the top and bottom nav bars with HTML and Jinja to determine what the user sees depending on which page the user is on and if they are logged in or not. I intentionally chose this as a way to create a clean user interface to streamline the user experience when we're navigating the app.

4. Update their account information 
The buttons contain hover and active css for visible changes for the user. And when the user clicks the Edit button to edit their account information, the input fields turn the pink-beige color of the set color palette of the app. I had a lot of fun coding this Javascript with styling, listener, and the fetch request to the server and handling the server-side and server's response.
